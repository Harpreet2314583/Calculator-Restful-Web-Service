Title Selection of Optimum Image Segmentation Parameters for Building Extraction using GeoEye-1 Image Data
Author Thaya Atsir Frishila, Muhammad Kamal
Affiliation Department of Geographic Information Science, Faculty of Geography, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia
Abstract The study focuses on the selection of optimum image segmentation parameters for building extraction using high-resolution GeoEye-1 image data. Accurate delineation and inventory of building objects are crucial for urban planning and disaster management. The research aims to identify the most relevant segmentation parameters for discriminating building objects from high-spatial resolution image data, particularly in urban areas. The Geographic Object Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) approach is employed, and the study site is in part of Padang City, West Sumatra, Indonesia.

Title: On Critical Sampling of Time-Vertex Graph Signals
Authors: Junhao Yu, Xuan Xie, Hui Feng, Bo Hu
Affiliation: Research Center of Smart Networks and Systems, School of Information Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China
Abstract: This paper focuses on the fundamental problem of sampling and reconstruction of joint time-vertex graph signals. The researchers prove the existence and necessary conditions of a critical sampling set using the minimum number of samples in the time and graph domains. The theory proposed suggests assigning a heterogeneous sampling pattern for each node in a network under the constraint of minimum resources. An efficient algorithm is provided to construct a critical sampling set.

Abstract:
ECG plays a vital role in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The proprietary APCOG Multi-Parameter Module (MPM) has been utilized for ECG signal acquisition. Applied Cognition Systems Pvt Ltd has developed a low-power and accurate MPM acquisition module for real-time ECG signal capture. This system supports wireless data acquisition, enabling the monitoring of vital signs for individuals with various diseases. The device aims to facilitate post-hospital treatment monitoring for patients, providing real-time data transmission to a local PC or mobile phone with minimal processing time and extended battery life. The portable nature of the device allows health workers to conduct routine check-ups and screenings, and in some cases, continuous monitoring. The ECG signal-related circuit functionality has been tested and validated, with detailed segments covering the proposed method, experimental setup, results, and conclusions.
